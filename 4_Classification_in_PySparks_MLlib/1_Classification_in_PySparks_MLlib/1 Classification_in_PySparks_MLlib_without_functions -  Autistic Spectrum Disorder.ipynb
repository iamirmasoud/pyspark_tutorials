    "# Classification in PySpark's MLlib\n",
    "\n",
    "PySpark offers a good variety of algorithms that can be applied to classification machine learning problems. However, because PySpark operates on distributed dataframes, we cannot use popular Python libraries like scikit learn for our machine learning applications. Which means we need to use PySpark's MLlib packages for these tasks. Luckily, MLlib offers a pretty good variety of algorithms! In this notebook we will go over how to prep our data and train and test the classification algorithms PySpark offers. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "As we went over in the concept review lecture, classification is a supervised machine learning task where we want to automatically categorize our data into some pre-defined categorization method. Examples of classification might include sorting objects like flowers into various species or automatically labeling images into groups like cat, dog, fish, etc. To be able to do this though, we need to have training data and a pre-defined dependent variable which is the column in your dataset that defines the categories you want to predict. \n",

    "Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopment condition associated with significant health care costs, and early diagnosis can significantly reduce these. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The Problem**: Unfortunately, waiting times for an ASD diagnosis are lengthy and procedures are not cost effective. The economic impact of autism and the increase in the number of ASD cases across the world reveals an urgent need for the development of easily implemented and effective screening methods. Therefore, a time-efficient and accessible ASD screening is imminent to help health professionals and inform individuals whether they should pursue formal clinical diagnosis. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset**:\n",
    "The rapid growth in the number of ASD cases worldwide necessitates datasets related to behaviour traits. However, such datasets are rare making it difficult to perform thorough analyses to improve the efficiency, sensitivity, specificity and predictive accuracy of the ASD screening process. Presently, very limited autism datasets associated with clinical or screening are available and most of them are genetic in nature. Hence, we propose a new dataset related to autism screening of adults that contained 20 features to be utilised for further analysis especially in determining influential autistic traits and improving the classification of ASD cases. In this dataset, we record ten behavioural features (AQ-10-Adult) plus ten individuals characteristics that have proved to be effective in detecting the ASD cases from controls in behaviour science.\n",

    "#### Treating for skewness and outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from the Model Selection and Tuning lecture that Skewness measures how much a distribution of values deviates from symmetry around the mean. A value of zero means the distribution is symmetric, while a positive skewness indicates a greater number of smaller values, and a negative value indicates a greater number of larger values. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a general rule of thumb: \n",
    "\n",
    " - If skewness is **less than -1 or greater than 1**, the distribution is highly skewed. \n",
    " - If skewness is **between -1 and -0.5 or between 0.5 and 1**, the distribution is moderately skewed. \n",
    " - If skewness is **between -0.5 and 0.5**, the distribution is approximately symmetric.\n",
    " \n",
    "A common recommendation for treating skewness is either a log transformation for positive skewed data or an exponential transformation for negatively skewed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outliers** <br>\n",
    "One common way to correct outliers is by flooring and capping which means editing any value that is above or below a certain threshold (99th percentile or 1st percentile) back to the highest/lowest value in that percentile. For example, if the 99th percentile is 96 and there is a value of 1,000, you would change that value to 96. "

    "#### Add in cross validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark also has a built-in function called the CrossValidator to conduct cross validation which begins by splitting the training dataset into a set of \"folds\" which are used as separate training and test datasets. For example, with k=5 folds, CrossValidator will generate 5 different (training, test) dataset pairs, each of which uses 4/5 of the data for training and 1/5 for testing. To evaluate a particular Parameter (specified in the paramgrid), CrossValidator computes the average evaluation metric for the 5 Models produced by fitting the Estimator on the 5 different (training, test) dataset pairs and tells you which model performed the best once it is finished. \n",

There is no clear formula for setting the optimum iteration number, but you can figure out this issue by an iterative process by initializing the iteration number by a small number like 100 and then increase it linearly.

    "**Recap from the lecture** <br>\n",
    "A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a class of feedforward artificial neural network. It consists of at least three layers of nodes: an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer. Except for the input nodes, each node is a neuron that uses a nonlinear activation function. MLP utilizes a supervised learning technique called backpropagation for training. Its multiple layers and non-linear activation distinguish MLP from a linear perceptron. It can distinguish data that is not linearly separable.\n",

    "**MaxIter:** <br>\n",
    "The maximum number of iterations to use. There is no clear formula for setting the optimum iteration number, but you can figure out this issue by an iterative process by initializing the iteration number by a small number like 100 and then increase it linearly. This process will be repeated until the MSE of the test does not decrease and even may increase. The below link describes well:\n",

    "**What is Naive Bayes classifier?**\n",
    "The Naive Bayes Classifier is a collection of classification algorithms based on Bayes Theorem. It is not a single algorithm but a family of algorithms that all share a common principle, that every feature being classified is independent of the value of any other feature. \n",
    "\n",
    "So for example, a fruit may be considered to be an apple if it is red, round, and about 3″ in diameter. A Naive Bayes classifier considers each of these “features” (red, round, 3” in diameter) to contribute independently to the probability that the fruit is an apple, regardless of any correlations between features. Features, however, aren't always independent which is often seen as a shortcoming of the Naive Bayes algorithm and this is why it's labeled “naive”.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions:**\n",
    " - Independence between every pair of features\n",
    " - Feature values are nonnegative (which is why we checked earlier)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hyper Parameters:**\n",
    "\n",
    " - **smoothing** = It is problematic when a frequency-based probability is zero, because it will wipe out all the information in the other probabilities, and we need to find a solution for this. A solution would be Laplace smoothing , which is a technique for smoothing categorical data. In PySpark, this number needs to be be >= 0, default is 1.0'. Also here is a great article that defines smoothing in more detail: https://medium.com/syncedreview/applying-multinomial-naive-bayes-to-nlp-problems-a-practical-explanation-4f5271768ebf\n",
    " - **thresholds** = Thresholds in multi-class classification to adjust the probability of predicting each class. Array must have length equal to the number of classes, with values > 0, excepting that at most one value may be 0. The class with largest value p/t is predicted, where p is the original probability of that class and t is the class's threshold. The default value is none. \n",
    " - **weightCol** = If you have a weight column you would enter the name of the column here. If this is not set or empty, we treat all instance weights as 1.0. To learn more about the theory behind this, here is a good paper: http://pami.uwaterloo.ca/~khoury/ece457f07/Zhang2004.pdf"

    "Linear SVMs are based on the idea of finding a hyperplane that best divides a dataset into two classes, which is why you can only use it for binary classification. Support vectors are the data points nearest to the hyperplane, the points of a data set that, if removed, would alter the position of the dividing hyperplane. Because of this, they can be considered the critical elements of a data set. Intuitively, the further from the hyperplane our data points lie, the more confident we are that they have been correctly classified. We therefore want our data points to be as far away from the hyperplane as possible, while still being on the correct side of it. So when new testing data is added, whatever side of the hyperplane it lands will decide the class that we assign to it.\n",

    "\n",
    "You can even learn something about the importance of each feature. Let's say the SVM would find only one feature useful for separating the data, then the hyperplane would be orthogonal to that axis. So, you could say that the absolute size of the coefficient relative to the other ones gives an indication of how important the feature was for the separation. \n",

The deeper the tree, the more complex the decision rules and the fitter the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Decision tree builds classification or regression models in the form of a tree structure. It breaks down a data set into smaller and smaller subsets while at the same time an associated decision tree is incrementally developed. The final result is a tree with decision nodes and leaf nodes. A decision node has two or more branches. Leaf node represents a classification or decision. The topmost decision node in a tree which corresponds to the best predictor called root node. Decision trees can handle both categorical and numerical data.\n",

Some implementations sort the feature values and then use the ordered unique values as split candidates for faster tree calculations.\n",
    "         Sorting feature values is expensive for large distributed datasets. This implementation computes an approximate set of split candidates by performing a quantile calculation over a sampled fraction of the data. The ordered splits create “bins” and the maximum number of such bins can be specified using the maxBins parameter.\n",

    "     - **Categorical features:** For a categorical feature with M possible values (categories), one could come up with 2 exp(M−1) −1 split candidates. For binary (0/1) classification and regression, we can reduce the number of split candidates to M−1 by ordering the categorical feature values by the average label. For example, for a binary classification problem with one categorical feature with three categories A, B and C whose corresponding proportions of label 1 are 0.2, 0.6 and 0.4, the categorical features are ordered as A, C, B. The two split candidates are A | C, B and A , C | B where | denotes the split.\n",
    "         In multiclass classification, all 2 exp(M−1) −1 possible splits are used whenever possible. When 2 exp(M−1) −1 is greater than the maxBins parameter, we use a (heuristic) method similar to the method used for binary classification and regression. The M categorical feature values are ordered by impurity, and the resulting M−1 split candidates are considered.\n",

    "## Gradient Boost Tree Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With gradient boosting, it's more of a hierarchical approach. It combines the weak learners (binary splits) to strong prediction rules that allow a flexible partition of the feature space. The objective here, as is of any supervised learning algorithm, is to define a loss function and minimize it. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Hyper Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    " - **maxBins** = Max number of bins for discretizing continuous features. Must be >=2 and >= number of categories for any categorical feature.\n",
    "     - **Continuous features:** For small datasets in single-machine implementations, the split candidates for each continuous feature are typically the unique values for the feature. Some implementations sort the feature values and then use the ordered unique values as split candidates for faster tree calculations.\n",
    "         Sorting feature values is expensive for large distributed datasets. This implementation computes an approximate set of split candidates by performing a quantile calculation over a sampled fraction of the data. The ordered splits create “bins” and the maximum number of such bins can be specified using the maxBins parameter.\n",
    "         Note that the number of bins cannot be greater than the number of instances N (a rare scenario since the default maxBins value is 32). The tree algorithm automatically reduces the number of bins if the condition is not satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "     - **Categorical features:** For a categorical feature with M possible values (categories), one could come up with 2 exp(M−1) −1 split candidates. For binary (0/1) classification and regression, we can reduce the number of split candidates to M−1 by ordering the categorical feature values by the average label. For example, for a binary classification problem with one categorical feature with three categories A, B and C whose corresponding proportions of label 1 are 0.2, 0.6 and 0.4, the categorical features are ordered as A, C, B. The two split candidates are A | C, B and A , C | B where | denotes the split.\n",

When 2 exp(M−1) −1 is greater than the maxBins parameter, we use a (heuristic) method similar to the method used for binary classification and regression.
