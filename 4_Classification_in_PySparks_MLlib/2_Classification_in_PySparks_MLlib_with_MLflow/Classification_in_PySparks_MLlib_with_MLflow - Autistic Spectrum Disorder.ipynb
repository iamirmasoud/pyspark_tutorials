    "# Leveraging MLflow to better track and manage your results\n",
    "\n",
    "MLflow is organized into four components: **Tracking**, **Projects**, **Models**, and **Model Registry**. You can use each of these components on their own—for example, maybe you want to export models in MLflow’s model format without using Tracking or Projects—but they are also designed to work well together. So this notebook will focus on only the **Tracking** component within the PySpark environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is tracking useful/important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning typically requires experimenting with a diverse set of hyperparameter tuning techniques, data preparation steps, and algorithms to build a model that maximizes some target metric. Given this complexity, building a machine learning model can therefore be challenging for a couple of reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **It’s difficult to keep track of experiments.** When you are just working with files on your laptop, or with an interactive notebook, how do you tell which data, code and parameters went into getting a particular result?\n",
    "2. **It’s difficult to reproduce code.** Even if you have meticulously tracked the code versions and parameters, you need to capture the whole environment (for example, library dependencies) to get the same result again. This is especially challenging if you want another data scientist to use your code, or if you want to run the same code at scale on another platform (for example, in the cloud).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution that MLflow Tracking provides\n",
    "\n",
    "MLflow Tracking is an API and UI for logging parameters, code versions, metrics, and artifacts when running your machine learning code and for later visualizing the results. You can use MLflow Tracking in any environment (for example, a standalone script or a notebook) to log results to local files or to a server, then compare multiple runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to install MLflow\n",
    "\n",
    "You simply install MLflow by running *\"pip install mlflow\"* via the command line. Please reference the Quick Start Guide here for more details: https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/quickstart.html\n",
    "\n",
    "### Viewing the Tracking MLflow UI\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, wherever you run your program (Jupyter Notebook in this case), the tracking API writes data into files into a local ./mlruns directory. First you need to open your mlflow intance via the command line (cd into the folder where this notebook is stored). You can then run MLflow’s Tracking UI: http://localhost:5000/#/\n",

    "### Data Set Name: Autistic Spectrum Disorder Screening Data for Adult\n",
    "Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopment condition associated with significant healthcare costs, and early diagnosis can significantly reduce these. Unfortunately, waiting times for an ASD diagnosis are lengthy and procedures are not cost effective. The economic impact of autism and the increase in the number of ASD cases across the world reveals an urgent need for the development of easily implemented and effective screening methods. Therefore, a time-efficient and accessible ASD screening is imminent to help health professionals and inform individuals whether they should pursue formal clinical diagnosis. The rapid growth in the number of ASD cases worldwide necessitates datasets related to behaviour traits. However, such datasets are rare making it difficult to perform thorough analyses to improve the efficiency, sensitivity, specificity and predictive accuracy of the ASD screening process. Presently, very limited autism datasets associated with clinical or screening are available and most of them are genetic in nature. Hence, we propose a new dataset related to autism screening of adults that contained 20 features to be utilised for further analysis especially in determining influential autistic traits and improving the classification of ASD cases. In this dataset, we record ten behavioural features (AQ-10-Adult) plus ten individuals characteristics that have proved to be effective in detecting the ASD cases from controls in behaviour science.\n",

It works with either binary or multinomial (more than 2 categories) data and uses logistic function (ie. log) to find a model that fits with the data points.\n",

    "You may want to predict the likelihood of a student passing or failing an exam based on a set of biographical factors. The model you create will provide a probability (i.e a number between 0 and 1) that you can use to determine the likelihood of each student passing.\n",

    "## Logistic Regression with Cross Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark also has a built-in funciton called the CrossValidator to conduct cross validation which begins by splitting the training dataset into a set of \"folds\" which are used as separate training and test datasets. For example, with k=5 folds, CrossValidator will generate 5 different (training, test) dataset pairs, each of which uses 4/5 of the data for training and 1/5 for testing. To evaluate a particular Parameter (specified in the paramgrid), CrossValidator computes the average evaluation metric for the 5 Models produced by fitting the Estimator on the 5 different (training, test) dataset pairs and tells you which model performed the best once it is finished. \n",
    "\n",
    "After identifying the best ParamMap (more details can be found in the documentation link above), CrossValidator finally re-fits the Estimator using the best ParamMap and the entire dataset.\n",

    "The maximum number of iterations to use. There is no clear formula for setting the optimum iteration number, but you can figure out this issue by an iterative process by initializing the iteration number by a small number like 100 and then increase it linearly.

    "### Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recap from the lecture:**\n",
    "The Naive Bayes Classifier is a collection of classification algorithms based on Bayes Theorem. It is not a single algorithm but a family of algorithms that all share a common principle, that every feature being classified is independent of the value of any other feature. \n",
    "\n",
    "So for example, a fruit may be considered to be an apple if it is red, round, and about 3″ in diameter. A Naive Bayes classifier considers each of these “features” (red, round, 3” in diameter) to contribute independently to the probability that the fruit is an apple, regardless of any correlations between features. Features, however, aren’t always independent which is often seen as a shortcoming of the Naive Bayes algorithm and this is why it’s labeled “naive”.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions:**\n",
    " - Independence between every pair of features\n",
    " - Feature values are nonnegative (which is why we checked earlier)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hyper Parameters:**\n",
    "\n",
    " - **smoothing** = It is problematic when a frequency-based probability is zero, because it will wipe out all the information in the other probabilities, and we need to find a solution for this. A solution would be Laplace smoothing , which is a technique for smoothing categorical data. In PySpark, this number needs to be be >= 0, default is 1.0'. Also here is a great article that defines smoothing in more detail: https://medium.com/syncedreview/applying-multinomial-naive-bayes-to-nlp-problems-a-practical-explanation-4f5271768ebf\n",
    " - **thresholds** = Thresholds in multi-class classification to adjust the probability of predicting each class. Array must have length equal to the number of classes, with values > 0, excepting that at most one value may be 0. The class with largest value p/t is predicted, where p is the original probability of that class and t is the class's threshold. The default value is none. \n",
    " - **weightCol** = If you have a weight column you would enter the name of the column here. If this is not set or empty, we treat all instance weights as 1.0. To learn more about the theory behind this, here is a good paper: http://pami.uwaterloo.ca/~khoury/ece457f07/Zhang2004.pdf"

    "\n",
    "**Recap from lecture:**\n",
    "Linear SVMs are based on the idea of finding a hyperplane that best divides a dataset into two classes, which is why you can only use it for binary classification. Support vectors are the data points nearest to the hyperplane, the points of a data set that, if removed, would alter the position of the dividing hyperplane. Because of this, they can be considered the critical elements of a data set. Intuitively, the further from the hyperplane our data points lie, the more confident we are that they have been correctly classified. We therefore want our data points to be as far away from the hyperplane as possible, while still being on the correct side of it. So when new testing data is added, whatever side of the hyperplane it lands will decide the class that we assign to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretting the coefficients:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each coefficients direction gives us the predicted class, so if you take the dot product of any point with the vector, you can tell on which side it is: if the dot product is positive, it belongs to the positive class, if it is negative it belongs to the negative class.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can even learn something about the importance of each feature. Let's say the svm would find only one feature useful for separating the data, then the hyperplane would be orthogonal to that axis. So, you could say that the absolute size of the coefficient relative to the other ones gives an indication of how important the feature was for the separation. \n",

    "The maximum number of iterations to use. There is no clear formula for setting the optimum iteration number, but you can figure out this issue by an iterative process by initializing the iteration number by a small number like 100 and then increase it linearly. This process will be repeated until the MSE of the test does not decrease and even may increase. The below link describes well:\n",

    "**Recall from the lecture:**\n",
    "Decision Trees classifiers  are a supervised learning method used to classify a variable by learning from historical data that the model uses to approximate a sine curve with a set of if-then-else decision rules. The deeper the tree, the more complex the decision rules and the fitter the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Decision tree builds classification or regression models in the form of a tree structure. It breaks down a data set into smaller and smaller subsets while at the same time an associated decision tree is incrementally developed. The final result is a tree with decision nodes and leaf nodes. A decision node has two or more branches. Leaf node represents a classification or decision. The topmost decision node in a tree which corresponds to the best predictor called root node. Decision trees can handle both categorical and numerical data.\n",

    "### Common Hyper Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    " - **maxBins** = Max number of bins for discretizing continuous features. Must be >=2 and >= number of categories for any categorical feature.\n",
    "     - **Continuous features:** For small datasets in single-machine implementations, the split candidates for each continuous feature are typically the unique values for the feature. Some implementations sort the feature values and then use the ordered unique values as split candidates for faster tree calculations.\n",
    "         Sorting feature values is expensive for large distributed datasets. This implementation computes an approximate set of split candidates by performing a quantile calculation over a sampled fraction of the data. The ordered splits create “bins” and the maximum number of such bins can be specified using the maxBins parameter.\n",
    "         Note that the number of bins cannot be greater than the number of instances N (a rare scenario since the default maxBins value is 32). The tree algorithm automatically reduces the number of bins if the condition is not satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "     - **Categorical features:** For a categorical feature with M possible values (categories), one could come up with 2 exp(M−1) −1 split candidates. For binary (0/1) classification and regression, we can reduce the number of split candidates to M−1 by ordering the categorical feature values by the average label. For example, for a binary classification problem with one categorical feature with three categories A, B and C whose corresponding proportions of label 1 are 0.2, 0.6 and 0.4, the categorical features are ordered as A, C, B. The two split candidates are A | C, B and A , C | B where | denotes the split.\n",
    "         In multiclass classification, all 2 exp(M−1) −1 possible splits are used whenever possible. When 2 exp(M−1) −1 is greater than the maxBins parameter, we use a (heuristic) method similar to the method used for binary classification and regression. The M categorical feature values are ordered by impurity, and the resulting M−1 split candidates are considered.\n",

    "## Gradient Boost Tree Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recall from the lecture**\n",
    "With gradient boosting, it’s more of a hierarchical approach. It combines the weak learners (binary splits) to strong prediction rules that allow a flexble partition of the feature space. The objective here, as is of any supervised learning algorithm, is to define a loss function and minimize it. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Hyper Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    " - **maxBins** = Max number of bins for discretizing continuous features. Must be >=2 and >= number of categories for any categorical feature.\n",
    "     - **Continuous features:** For small datasets in single-machine implementations, the split candidates for each continuous feature are typically the unique values for the feature. Some implementations sort the feature values and then use the ordered unique values as split candidates for faster tree calculations.\n",
    "         Sorting feature values is expensive for large distributed datasets. This implementation computes an approximate set of split candidates by performing a quantile calculation over a sampled fraction of the data. The ordered splits create “bins” and the maximum number of such bins can be specified using the maxBins parameter.\n",
    "         Note that the number of bins cannot be greater than the number of instances N (a rare scenario since the default maxBins value is 32). The tree algorithm automatically reduces the number of bins if the condition is not satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "     - **Categorical features:** For a categorical feature with M possible values (categories), one could come up with 2 exp(M−1) −1 split candidates. For binary (0/1) classification and regression, we can reduce the number of split candidates to M−1 by ordering the categorical feature values by the average label. For example, for a binary classification problem with one categorical feature with three categories A, B and C whose corresponding proportions of label 1 are 0.2, 0.6 and 0.4, the categorical features are ordered as A, C, B. The two split candidates are A | C, B and A , C | B where | denotes the split.\n",
    "         In multiclass classification, all 2 exp(M−1) −1 possible splits are used whenever possible. When 2 exp(M−1) −1 is greater than the maxBins parameter, we use a (heuristic) method similar to the method used for binary classification and regression. The M categorical feature values are ordered by impurity, and the resulting M−1 split candidates are considered.\n",
    "         \n",
    " - **maxDepth** = The maxDepth parameter specifies the maximum depth of each tree. The default value for max_depth is None, which means that each tree will expand until every leaf is pure. A pure leaf is one where all of the data on the leaf comes from the same class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Importance Scores\n",
    "Scores add up to 1 accross all varaibles so the lowest score is the least imporant variable. \n",
